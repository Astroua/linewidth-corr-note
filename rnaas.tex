\section{}

Spectral-line observations are systematically broadened by the response function of the spectrometer. Although analyses in the radio and submillimetre often assume independent channels, the spectral response function is a combination of instrumentation and signal processing, just like at other wavelengths.  Typical observing strategies resolve lines with $\sim3\mbox{--}5$ channels per full-width-half-max, which will bias spectral-line properties---including line width measurements--- without accounting for the spectral response.  In this note, we compare different methods for inferring the line width of a Gaussian and how the spectral response affects them.

We consider a noiseless single Gaussian with width $\sigma$ as the simplest model. Using an ideal spectrometer, each channel is independent and the Gaussian is smoothed with a top-hat kernel one channel in width ($\Delta v$). This smoothing gives the observed spectrum a lower amplitude and larger $\sigma$, which becomes more extreme as $\Delta v \rightarrow \sigma$.

Real radio observations have a more complex spectral response than a top-hat.  Fourier transform spectrometers typically have a sinc or sinc-like response in frequency, and signal not aligned to the channel centres will exhibit ``ringing.''  Apodizing kernels, such as the Hann kernel, reduce this ringing at the expense of correlating nearby channels\footnote{\url{https://safe.nrao.edu/wiki/pub/Main/ALMAWindowFunctions/Note_on_Spectral_Response.pdf}}.  Some instruments have well-characterized response functions that can be modelled in observed spectra \citep{rosolowsky2008}.  Without this information, a three-element Hann-like kernel ($[k, 1 - 2k, k]$ with channel-coupling $k$) can approximate the nearest-neighbour channel correlations \citep{leroy2016}.

The top row in Figure \ref{fig:width_recovery_comparison} show a Gaussian averaged over independent channels and convolved with a Hann-like kernel with $\Delta v=\sigma$.  The two panels exhibit how line broadening changes when the line is positioned in the centre and edge of a channel. The former minimally broadens the Gaussian, while the latter is the worst-case of broadening.  The peak location depends on the source and cannot be assumed beforehand.
% , which requires accounting for the spectral response to recover the correct line properties.

To recover the line properties, the spectral response can be included in the model for the observed spectrum.  We forward-model the spectral response by averaging the Gaussian over the channels and convolving with a Hann-like kernel ($k=0.11$) prior to fitting the observed spectrum.  Forward-modelling the spectral response is common-practice in many fields \citep[e.g.,][]{martin2015}, but is seldom used in radio studies.  Because no noise is added, this model is defined to recover the correct line properties.

While forward-modelling accounts for the spectral response, the spectrum must be fit, which requires knowing a correct model and may be affected by noise.  Instead, many studies adopt approximate methods for the line width assuming a Gaussian shape. We compare the forward-model fit with four methods:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item {\bf Fit to Gaussian} without forward-modelling.
    \item {\bf Moment 2}: $\sigma_{\rm Mom2}=\sqrt{\sum_i T_i (v_i - v_0)^2 / \sum_i T_i}$ where $T_i$ is the value at $v_i$ and $v_0$ is the centroid.
    \item {\bf Equivalent width}: $\sigma_{\rm equiv} = T_{\rm peak} / \sqrt{2\pi} \Sigma$ where $T_{\rm peak}$ is the measured amplitude and $\Sigma= \sum_i T_i \Delta v$ \citep{heyer2001,leroy2016,sun2018}.
    \item {\bf Half-width-half-max (HWHM)} estimated from where the observed spectrum is half the peak \citep{stilp2013a,stilp2013b,koch2018}.
\end{enumerate}

Many radio studies correct the measured line width based on a top-hat kernel, assumed to equal the area of a Gaussian equal to the rectangular area over one channel. This factor is subtracted in quadrature from the measured line width \citep{cprops}.  To account for channel correlations, \citet{leroy2016} extended this correction factor with an empirical calibration relating channel-to-channel correlations ($r$) to a Hann-like kernel:
% ($k\approx 0.0 + 0.47r - 0.23r^2 - 0.16r^3 + 0.43 r^4$).
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:leroy16_corrfact}
    \sigma_{\rm chan} \approx \frac{\Delta v}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \left( 1.0 + 1.18k + 10.4 k^2 \right).
\end{equation}
As $k\rightarrow0$, the term in brackets approaches unity to the assumed correction factor of a top-hat response.  We adopt $k=0.11$ for our example \citep[see][]{sun2018}.

We generate model spectra varying the sampling $\Delta v / \sigma$ and calculate the line width from each method, with and without subtracting Eq. \ref{eq:leroy16_corrfact}. We also compare observed spectra with independent channels (top-hat) and correlated by a Hann-like kernel. The bottom four panels in Figure \ref{fig:width_recovery_comparison} show the measured line widths.

When the line is centered on a channel (first column), the line width methods are similarly biased and convolving with a Hann-like kernel only broadens the spectra.  Line widths are over-corrected with Eq. \ref{eq:leroy16_corrfact} when $k=0$, but are within $<5\%$ when correlated with the Hann-like kernel for $\sigma/\Delta v \geq 1$.

There are deviations between the methods when the line is centered on the channel edge (second column). With independent and correlated channels, the Gaussian fit and second moment are biased similarly to when the peak is centered on a channel.  The equivalent width and HWHM are biased to larger values than the latter methods because they depend on the amplitude of the profile, which is underestimated more than in the channel-centre case. Eq. \ref{eq:leroy16_corrfact} {\it underestimates} the line broadening in this case. Methods that leverage information across many channels are preferable over those that use only the line core when $\sigma / \Delta v < 2$. 

Our results show:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Line width measurements depend on the spectral response and must be modelled correctly. In our example, a Hann-like kernel increased measured line widths by $\sim10\%$ compared to the top-hat kernel.
    \item The correction factor most often used in radio analyses (Eq. \ref{eq:leroy16_corrfact}; $k=0$) does not correct for line width broadening in any case.  $\Delta v / \sqrt{2\pi}$ is not the correct line width contribution for a top-hat kernel.
    \item To measure line widths within $<5\%$ of the actual line width for correlated channels, channel widths of $\sigma / \Delta v \geq 2$ are needed for fitting a Gaussian and the second moment, while $\sigma / \Delta v \geq 4$ is needed for the equivalent width and HWHM. Broadening from the spectral response can be considered negligible above these limits.  Where possible, we recommend that observational setups sample $\sigma / \Delta v > 2$ (or $5$ channels per FWHM).
    \item When fitting an analytical model to observed data, it is vastly preferable to forward-model with a spectral response function when $\sigma / \Delta v \leq 2$.
    \item Methods that estimate the line width with information over multiple channels (fitting, second moment) are preferable over those that use only the line core (equivalent width, HWHM). These latter methods can place upper limits on the line width, but should be treated with caution when $\sigma / \Delta v <4$.
\end{enumerate}

We stress that these recommendations are only for {\it high signal-to-noise, Gaussian spectra}. Noise or multi-component spectra will change the biases for these methods and can be explored for individual data sets.
% We also note that these methods will break down when the Gaussian assumption is invalid \citep{koch2018}.

% The examples in Figure \ref{fig:width_recovery_comparison} do not include noise in the spectra.  We test the forward-modelling model in the presence of noise drawn to give a peak signal-to-noise of 5 in the spectrum.  The noisy spectrum is then convolved with the response function used above to correlate the noise.  Drawing 1000 iterations of noise, we find that the fitted parameters are not biased by line broadening.  However, the Levenberg-Marquadt algorithm used for the fitting assumes that the noise is uncorrelated.  We test whether breaking this assumption significantly underestimates the parameter uncertainties from the covariance matrix by calculating the fraction of iterations that the true parameter value lies within the $1\mbox{-}\sigma$ uncertainty range from the fit.  We find that true values are within the uncertainty range in $\sim70\%$ of the iterations, similar to the expected $68.2\%$ for the $1\mbox{-}\sigma$ range for a Gaussian distribution.  The lack of modelling for correlated errors should not significantly change the uncertainties.  The correlated noise may become more important if the spectral response function correlates channels beyond their nearest neighbours.  In that case, a Gaussian process can be used to model the correlated uncertainties XXX rasmussen and michaels XXX.
