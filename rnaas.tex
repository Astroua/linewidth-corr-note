\caption{\label{fig:1} Right: Position of the OH detection on an integrated 21-cm map of M33 (Koch et al., in prep). Top Left: Spectrum at the peak intensity position. The dashed green line is the noise level at 1.85 mJy and the thick orange line is a Gaussian fit. Bottom Left: H$\alpha$ image of the region shown in the right panel \citep{hodge1999}.  Sources from the \citet{moody2017} catalogue are shown in blue within the beam area, and green for nearby regions [from left to right, C1-10 \citep{moody2017}, 79a and 79c \citep{boul1974}].}
